# Medical-Store-Management-System-using-C
The project titled Medical Store Management System is an application developed to monitor and control the activities performed in a medical store such as, add medicine details, delete medicine details, view the available medicines, search for medicines, edit medicine details, purchase medicines and many more. Managing a pharmacy manually can be a tedious task. There are higher probabilities of data loss in the manual system and it also consumes a lot of time. Therefore, to make the process of managing a medical store easier and effective, the above proposed system can be adapted.
